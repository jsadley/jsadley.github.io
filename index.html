		<h1>Guns Are Killing Us</h1>
		<p>Here are three reasons not to own a gun.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="container">
<h2>1. Guns don't make you safer.</h2>
<p>A study found that handgun purchasers were <strong><a href="http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/9/1/48.full">ten times more likely to die from a violent death</a></strong>.  Owning a gun <strong>may make you feel safe</strong>, but really <strong>it makes you far more likely to die.</strong></p>

<h2>2. Guns don't make the rest of us safer.</h2>
<p>According to a study, firearm homicide rates were <strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20571454">nineteen times higher</a></strong> in the U.S. than other high-income countries.  For 15-year olds to 24-year olds, firearm homicide rates were <strong>over forty times higher</strong>.  Guns are killing us.</p>

<h2>3. Guns make you look like a coward.</h2>
<p>Possessing an instrument that increases your own risk of death and increases other people's risk of death can only be justified by people who are overcome by fear.</p>
